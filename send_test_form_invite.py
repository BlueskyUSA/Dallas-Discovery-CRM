"""
One-off: sends a single test email to khres53@gmail.com with links to both
the short form (/discovery) and the long form (/complete-profile), so Kent
can click through and test them end-to-end.

This is NOT wired into any route -- just a script to run by hand, once,
from the Render shell (where BREVO_API_KEY is actually set):

    python3 send_test_form_invite.py

Safe to run more than once -- it just sends another copy of the same email.
