"""
"Have a Discovery team member call you" -- the interested-party call flow.

How it works
  1. Someone fills in the short form (front page, program pages, or the Reserve form) and answers Yes/No to
     "Do we have permission to call and text you on your cell phone?"
  2. On Yes, a call request is saved and the volunteers for that program (set up on the Call volunteers page,
     up to six per program, plus a Lead Guide) are alerted. Each alert has a personal link.
  3. The first volunteer to open their link and tap "I'll call within 2 hours" gets the request. The others see
     "already claimed". The interested person is then told the volunteer's name and number.
  4. After calling, the volunteer logs the outcome on the same link.
  5. If nobody claims it in 2 hours, the volunteers are alerted again and Kent is emailed. If a volunteer claims it
     but hasn't logged the call after 2 hours, they get a reminder.

Safety switches (nothing is sent to real people until you turn this on)
  CALL_ALERTS_LIVE=1   in Render's Environment turns the emails on. Until then requests are only saved and shown
                       on the Call requests page.
  Alerts only go out between 8 am and 8 pm Central; anything that comes in overnight goes out at 8 am.

Texting is not built yet (it needs a texting service and registration). The messages are emails for now; the
consent answer and wording are saved so texting can be added later.
