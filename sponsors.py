"""Sponsors: a volunteer who wants to sponsor someone fills out a form on the website and gets a private page,
the same page a Guide uses (/call/<token>), to manage the person they sponsor.

Steps:  /sponsor            -> ONE short form: the volunteer's own details, the person they want to sponsor, and a permission box.
                               We then email the volunteer a letter (editable under Correspondence): complete your long form (and add a
                               photo), and here is the private web page you will get.
        /sponsor/thanks/<t> -> shows the private page link.
        The private page (/call/<token>) opens only after the volunteer's long form and photo are complete; until then it shows
        what is still needed.
        /sponsor-training   -> a short guide for Sponsors.
Behind the scenes a Sponsor is a row in call_volunteers with program_code 'SPONSOR' (never part of the Guide alert groups),
and the sponsored person is a call_requests row already claimed by that Sponsor, so checklist, letters, payment nudges and
milestone notices all work exactly as they do for Guides."""
